Services

</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>

I offer all kinds of services including (but not limited to):

</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>

web programming

</li>
<li>

consulting (including training/coaching/mentoring; read more below)

</li>
</ul>
<p>

I consider myself a full-service provider: Although I’m not a designer
there are lots of good designers in my professional network who you can
hire through me (which might give you a little discount as well). You
can then either deal with them directly or through me – or both.

</p>

Contact me at <a href="mailto:office@railway.at">office@railway.at</a>
for specific questions regarding my services and/or if you want to
<a href="/hire">hire me</a>!

<h3>

Rates

</h3>
<p>

I’m a big fan of the open company philosophy and transparency in general
– which is why I tell you pretty much <a href="/rates">everything you
might want to know about my rates</a> right here online. No bullshit, no
“oh, they’re a big company so I can charge them more” mentality.
