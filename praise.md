I had a great pair programming session with Clemens yesterday. \[…\] I
was quite impressed by his ability to grasp the scope and details of the
project after just a brief introduction. \[…\] Clemens was altogether
very approachable and pleasant to work with. I would definitely like to
keep contact in the future.
