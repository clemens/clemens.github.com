A couple of days ago, I received the confirmation that I'll be speaking about "Rails i18n":http://rails-i18n.org at "Rails Underground":http://www.rails-underground.com in London. I'm really looking forward to this since it will be my first big speaking gig.

If you have any suggestions on what I could/should include in my talk (I've got 45 minutes), please feel free to leave a comment or write me an e-mail.

Looking forward to seeing you in London!
