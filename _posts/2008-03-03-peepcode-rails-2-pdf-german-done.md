I’ve finished translating [Ryan Daigle’s](http://ryandaigle.com/)
bestselling [Rails 2 book](http://peepcode.com/products/rails2-pdf)
(published by [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com)) on the weekend. As soon
as it’s been through a final layout check, it will be available on the
Peepcode site for $9 or as a part of your subscription.

If you have any feedback regarding my translation, please be sure to
drop me a line (either via e-mail or in the comments).
