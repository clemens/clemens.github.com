This will be my shortest blog post ever because I basically only have one thing to get off my chest:

_A good programmer is someone who embraces the advent of new technology as an *opportunity to learn* something new rather than to replace something existent just because the new thing is oh-so shiny and hip._

"Trend whoring"::http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trendwhore is never trendy â€“ what is trendy is *critically evaluating new technology and using it where appropriate*.

That is all. Now go back to whatever you were doing.
