After nearly two years of Rails development it's more than time that I released my first (official) plugin. So here it goes.

If you've watched Rails on "Lighthouse":http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/ and "GitHub":http://github.com/rails/rails lately, you've probably noticed that I've proposed quite a number of patches, especially regarding the new "Rails i18n plugin":http://rails-i18n.org/ (which by the way got me the 2nd place in the "July 2008 Rails Hackfest":http://hackfest.rubyonrails.org/2008/7 - congrats to Tarmo TÃ¤nav at this point).

However, the date and time API got only partial i18n/l10n coverage - date and time formatting wasn't included - which is where my new plugin, localized_dates, might come in handy.

The quickest way to get going is to simply install the plugin from its GitHub repository:

<pre>
$ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/clemens/localized_dates.git
</pre>

As part of its installation, this will copy two locale files (en-US.rb and de-AT.rb) to your config/locales folder. en-US is basically there to keep the current functionality and date definitions in place. de-AT serves as a demo on how you can write your own locale.

If you need any further help, I suggest reading the "README over at GitHub":http://github.com/clemens/localized_dates/tree/master/README.
