I’ve long resisted the temptation of signing up for this time-consuming
thing that is [Twitter](http://twitter.com). However, after talking to
various guys at [RailsConf
Europe](http://www.railway.at/articles/tag/railsconf) - which all went
kind of “Whoa, seriously, dude - you don’t have a Twitter account?” - I
finally decided that it’s time to be a late adopter. So if you want to
follow me - feel free. You can find me
[here](http://twitter.com/clemensk).
