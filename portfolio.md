Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

When coming across the need for a better RBAC implementation for
<a href="http://adva-cms.org">adva_cms</a>, <a href="http://svenfuchs.com">Sven Fuchs</a> and
I decided to write one from scratch. It’s probably the most generic
piece of code I’ve ever written: In < 500 lines of code we’ve
implemented just about everything we might need for adva-cms - which is
a pretty complex system, mind you, so it should do just fine for almost
every use case.

Finally, I’ve contributed <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/clemens-kofler/commits">a number of patches</a>
