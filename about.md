<h4>

Clemens Kofler

</h4>
<p>

Clemens has been developing web applications since 2001, switching to
Rails some time in 2006 (after working some more or less painful years
with PHP). He has a solid background in (X)HTML, CSS and JavaScript and
builds some quite fancy AJAXy things, too. And don’t even get him
started on usability, design patterns, code efficiency and test driven
development …

</p>
<p>

Clemens holds a diploma degree in information systems from Management
Center Innsbruck which gives him a good background in commerce and
economics. He’s also currently studying to get his PhD in Management at
University of Innsbruck. He plays the guitar and the piano, sings and
enjoys good books. Contrary to what his friends might tell you, he also
occasionally does sports …
