I just got back from "Bratwurst on Rails":http://bratwurst-on-rails.com/ which, like last year, was a really awesome opportunity to get to know some of the folks that are going to be at "RailsConf Europe":http://railsconfeurope.com over the next few days. All those of you that I met: It was great meeting you! If you ever come to Austria, drop me a line - I can't promise a Bratwurst but we can definitely get a beer (or two). ;-)

As for RailsConf itself, I'll be attending the "Accessible AJAX on Rails":http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/schedule/detail/3584 and "Deploying and Monitoring Ruby on Rails":http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/schedule/detail/3562 on the first day. If you spot me (hint: "this":http://s3.amazonaws.com/actsascommunity/mediaplug_assets/98366/clemens-aac_user_photo_large.jpg is how I look these days), say hi!

I'll see if I can manage some coverage of the Conf - can't promise, though, as I'll probably be busy mingling. ;-)

Have fun at RailsConf Europe 2008!
