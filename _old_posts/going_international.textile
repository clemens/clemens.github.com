      <h3>What I can help you with</h3>

      <p>
        As a core team member of the <a href="http://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n">Ruby i18n library</a> and author of <a href="http://github.com/clemens">a couple of related plugins</a>, internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) are two of specialities and pet topics. If you plan to make your product available to international markets, my experience might be valuable for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the things I can do for you:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Kickstart i18n: If you want to internationalize right from the start, I can *train your developers* to do it properly and help set up the infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Review: If you have already internationalized your product, I can *review your existing code and strategies* and suggest improvements.</li>
        <li>Update blocker: If your product is based on custom internationalization work which prevents you from updating to current Rails versions, I can help you *migrate from your custom solution to Ruby/Rails' standard solutions*.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

      <p>
        My <a href="/rates">standard rates</a> apply. Contact me directly if you need a custom quote.

      <h3>Going International Package</h3>

      <p>
        There is no single package because the amount of work needed really depends on the specifics of your product. Setting up a basic i18n infrastructure and introducing your developers could take as little as a single day whereas a full-blown review and update of an existing application might take a whole lot longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to get internationalization right from the start, it could be part of the <a href="/bootstrap">Bootstrap package</a>. If you've been running into problems – one of them being internationalization –, consider buying the Going International package as part of the <a href="/plan_b">Plan B package</a>.
