      <p>
        If you're hiring young developers, sometimes straight from university, chances are they lack experience. Send them to *Training Camp* to turn them into proper Rubyists.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love passing on knowledge – you can hopefully tell from reading my <a href="/blog">blog</a> – and I've been tutoring students in programming languages and database systems for 2 years while studying at university – with good results and great feedback from my students and professors alike.
      </p>

      <h3>What I might teach your team</h3>

      <p>
        Here are some things inexperienced developers often lack and therefore might profit from my coaching:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Most people still learn C or Java at university and therefore have no clue about *Ruby style and idioms*. I can show them the ropes in Ruby.</li>
        <li>In my experience, *Object-oriented design and programming* and *software architecture* just aren't taught properly at university.</li>
        <li>Same goes for *agile development* and – even more importantly – *automated testing and test-driven development*.</li>
        <li>Inexperienced developers usually don't know basic *Design Patterns*. I can show them these important tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have specific things you want me to train your team in, please contact me.
      </p>

      <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

      <h3>Training Camp Package</h3>

      <p>
        Here's an example of what a Training Camp might look like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say your company has *3 developers* that you want me to coach for *3 days each* (something between 3 and 5 days makes the most sense, in my opinion). The schedule might look something like this:
      </p>

      <table>

            <th colspan="2" scope="row">before arrival</th>
