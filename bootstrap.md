You’ve done some non-technical planning, secured some funding, maybe
already hired a few skilled people and are ready to kickstart your
project?  
That’s where I might come in and help you **Bootstrap** the technical
part of your product.

</p>
<p>

Even seasoned developers tend to overlook important aspects of the big
picture – the architecture of your product. Even more so in the starting
phase of a product where it’s most crucial. I’m good at that. I can look
at technical drafts and identify potential weaknesses and bottlenecks in
the development framework, the server architecture etc. And more
importantly: I can tell you how to avoid them and design a system that
scales properly with increasing size and usage.

</p>
<p>

I can also help you set up proper project management that suits your
special needs. This might include tools (ticket management, time
tracking etc.), good practices (meetings, iteration planning, code
reviews etc.) and other not strictly technical things.

</p>
<p>

Most importantly: Owing to **my education in business and IT** combined
with **my extensive experience in software development and
architecture**, I will usually be able to understand both, business and
software development needs, and **bridge the gap between the business
guys and the techies**.

<h3>

What I can help you with

</h3>
<p>

Here are some examples where I might be able to be of service to you:

</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>

Feasibility: You’ve got a draft and need a technical estimate of how
complex your product is, whether or not your funding might be
sufficient, how many developers you need etc.

</li>
<li>

Architecture: You’ve got some UML or Entity-Relationship diagrams, a
functional spec or other documents detailing technical aspects of your
product and want an experienced software developer to look over it and
identify potential weaknesses.

</li>
<li>

Recruiting: You might need some assistance for screening potential
developers or even your CTO. I can give you an estimate of an
applicant’s technical suitability so you only have to worry about salary
and other non-technical aspects.

</li>
<li>

Coaching: I can help your (maybe inexperienced) team get started
properly – because most crucial errors tend to happen right at the start
of a new project.

</li>

etc.
