    <p>I am also a contributor and/or co-author to the following projects/plugins:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>
        <h4>adva-cms</h4>
        <p>"adva-cms":http://github.com/svenfuchs/adva_cms is a generic, engine-based Content Management System. It sports a module-based approach (thanks to Rails Engines) and baked-in internationalization support. You can find more information on "the adva-cms website":http://adva-cms.org.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>i18n / Rails i18n</h4>
        <p>The "i18n gem":http://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n as well as "Rails i18n":http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n provides the core for Rails' internationalization and localization features.</p>

        <p>"Sven Fuchs":http://svenfuchs.com and I wrote "Steam":http://github.com/svenfuchs/steam while working on a JavaScript-heavy application to support JavaScript-/AJAX-enabled full-stack integration testing.</p>

        <h4>Globalize2</h4>
        <p>"Globalize2":http://github.com/joshmh/globalize2 is the successor of the popular "Globalize":http://globalize-rails.com internationalization plugin for Rails (before the advent of "Rails i18n":http://rails-i18n.org).</p>

        <h4>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4>
        <p>When coming across the need for a better RBAC implementation for "adva-cms":http://adva-cms.org, "Sven Fuchs":http://svenfuchs.com and I decided to write one from scratch. It's probably the most generic piece of code I've ever written: In < 500 lines of code we've implemented just about everything we might need for adva-cms - which is a pretty complex system, mind you, so it should do just fine for almost every use case.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, I've contributed "a number of patches":http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/clemens-kofler/commits for the "Ruby on Rails framework":http://rubyonrails.org.</p>
