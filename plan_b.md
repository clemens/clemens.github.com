<p>

Let’s be honest: You don’t expect the unexpected. That’s why projects
need a **Plan B**.

<h3>

What I can help you with

</h3>
<p>

Here are some examples where I might be able to be of service to you:

</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>

Knowledge gap: You have run into technical problems that your current
team cannot solve alone.

</li>
<li>

Fast growth: You have grown faster than anticipated (lucky you!) and
need additional manpower until you can hire new employees.

</li>
<li>

Growing workforce: You have hired a couple of new employees but cannot
train them appropriately because your existing workforce is constantly
busy.

</li>
</ul>
<p>

You can always contact me and ask for specific services.
