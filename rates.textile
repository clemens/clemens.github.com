    <h2>Rates</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Most freelancers and agencies won't tell you their rates on their websites – mostly because they like to adjust their rates depending on how they estimate you as a client. I do tell you, because I like transparency and honesty, because *I treat all customers equally and because I'm confident that my rates match my level of experience*.
      </p>

      <h3>Standard rate</h3>

      <p>
        My current standard rate is *80 EUR/hour*. We can arrange for daily rates for on-site work or bigger/long term projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        This rate applies for consulting as well as for development and *doesn't include VAT/sales tax* (if applicable). Oh, and sorry: I don't accept foreign currencies – *Euros only*!
      </p>

      <h3>Discounted rates</h3>

      <p>
        If you want me to work on a project *regularly over a longer period* of time, we might negotiate a discounted rate. Discounts for *things that interest me personally* (say, technically challenging or working in a city/country I really want to visit) might be possible, too. I have worked for lower rates for *non profit organizations* in the past and I am definitely willing to do it again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please get in touch with me directly so we can discuss your options.
      </p>

      <h3>Fixed-bid projects</h3>

      <p>
        I usually don't go for fixed-bid projects because, frankly, somebody (either you or I or – worst case – both) is always going to be unhappy in the end. *I can work with a fixed budget*, though. I'll do my best to give a proper estimate whether or not I think that your project is doable with the given budget and we'll write user stories for the things you need. If your requirements change (and they probably will!) we can react to that by replacing outdated requirements with new ones. I'll always advise you as good as I can and definitely give notice if I think you might be running out of budget.
      </p>

      <h3>Profit sharing</h3>

      <p>
        I don't work based on pure profit sharing. If I think your project has potential, we might discuss options where you *hire me for a reduced rate in exchange for sharing some profits* later.
      </p>

      <h3>On-site work</h3>

      <p>
        If you want me to work on-site, you will have to *cover at least part of my travel and accommodation expenses*. I'm not picky, though: I need a clean single room with a bed, a shower and free (preferably unlimited) internet access – nothing fancy. By Central European standards, an average 2 star hotel, a good hostel or a guest room of an employee will do just fine.
      </p>

      <h3>Deposit</h3>

      <p>
        If you want to book me for a longer period and/or some time in advance, please note that I might consider negotiating a deposit with you. This is simply because I'll have to refuse other potential projects – if you then postpone the project last-minute that would seriously impact my cash flow. Don't worry, though: *I'm sure we can make arrangements that will be okay for you and me.*
